## Basic Git Commands

### Initializing a Repository
Create a new Git repository:
```sh
git init
```

### Cloning a Repository
Clone an existing repository:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Checking the Status
View the status of your files in the working directory and staging area:
```sh
git status
```

### Adding Changes
Add changes to the staging area:
```sh
git add <file>
```
Or add all changes:
```sh
git add .
```

### Committing Changes
Commit your staged changes with a descriptive message:
```sh
git commit -m "my first commit"
```

### Viewing Commit History
View the commit history of your repository:
```sh
git log
```

### Pushing Changes
Push your local commits to the remote repository:
```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Pulling Changes
Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository:
```sh
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

### Branching
Create a new branch:
```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```

Switch to a different branch:
```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Resolving Conflicts
If there are conflicts during a merge, Git will notify you. You need to manually resolve the conflicts in your files, then add and commit the resolved files:
```sh
git add <file>
git commit -m "my supercool commit"
```
